# Micro-Bit-Codes-And-Programming-ICS20

<h2> This is our group repository for the micro bit project!
 


<h3> What Did We Learn During The Class?

<br><ul>
 <h4><li> We learned how to code the micro bit.
 <h4><li> We learned how to download code of the computer and implement it onto the micro bit.
  <h4><li> We also learned about the radio signals that can be used to create the game of Hot & Cold!
   </ul>
    

<br><h3> How Is This Interesting And How Does It Relate To The World Of Programming And Coding?

<br> <h4><p> This is interesting because:<p>
 <ul>
 <h4><li> You learn about radio signals and how they can lose their connection when they get apart
 <li> We can create anything with microBit
  <li> Its a great way to learn coding!
  </ul>
    
<br><h3> Where Can WE Go From Here?

<h4><p> From here, what we can do is to, well, code more!
 microbit has so many things to do on in, the posibilities are endless!
 aswell as that we can also use our new knowledge for better! Now that we know how to download codes and implement them onto physical things, we can do so much!<p>
