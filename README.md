# Micro-Bit-Codes-And-Programming-ICS20

<h2> This is our group repository for the micro bit project!
 


<h2> What Did We Learn During The Class?

<br><ul>
 <h4> <li> We learned how to code the micro bit.
   <h4> <li> We learned how to download code of the computer and implement it onto the micro bit.
    <h4> <li> We also learned about the radio signals that can be used to create the game of Hot & Cold!
    

<br><h3> How Is This Interesting And How Does It Relate To The World Of Programming And Coding?

<br> <h4><p> This is interesting becuase:<p>
 <ul>
 <h4>  <li> You learn about radio signals and how they can lose their connection when they get apart
  <li> We can create anything with microBit
   <li> Its a great way to learn codeing!
    <li> Test
     <li> TEST #5

<h3> Where Can WE Go From Here?
